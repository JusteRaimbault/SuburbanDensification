[miss beginning]

* Benedicte : discussions with experts, policy people, decision makers

* Myself 5 papers [Q Thomas dreivers paper planning takeaway? Q Denise algo: better data? yes] + mention simplu3d-3d visu but not more info

* Denise prediction where densification will happen
Pb places with same caracs: false positives
-> potential densif -> scenarios (maximum, trend)
Q: which model? random forest. rq: idem Vera - deep learning bof
Q AM: balance? -> balance training data yes.
Q to me: spatial autocorr? yes what we do, but need a glm in any approach.
rq Bened: different predict: next time step - different than us.
climate? if market change ~ (stationarity!). Bene: local climate zones?
Mathias: owner?

* Tatiana: Exploring Development management
Development planning: assess and regulates new development.
Street-level bureaucrat
(soon end of project: more agressive interviews)

* Thomas: Bauturbo
(ex plot in Dortmund facing planning dpt- strong property right)
Different ways to get building rights: zoning plan (can deviate).
Change: 3 months for the municiplality to oppose only.
Zoning plan takes up to 9 years. Building sector wants to accelerate.

Last subdense moment -> tour de table

Me: impressive collab quanti quali, good planning results, very good in terms of algorithmics [?] and GIS
Vera: very nice collab quanti quali, Seb go check on the field
Denise: ?
Tatiana: municiplaities
Mark: perspectives different groups
Mathias: like jump between disciplines [forgot one paper with all PIs?]
Brendan: researching in Stsbg
Sebastian: continous learning curve, interest [?] in data science
AM: not expected [?], interesting to apply to other project
Benedicte: thanks for inviting, nice. New management style. Very listen and discuss, not parallel - not AI, DT. Approach triggered by Mathias -> engage with people at IGN. 
Thomas: 3 final remarks: mgt style?
1) "honor sitting with you"; easy project to steer, worked well on common papers [thght: pas tant que ca, nous pas vraiment, juste au debut matching mais pas finalisé]. 
2) Not much relief that other, many papers in making -> future collaborations [in France 3 months]. [idem DE prolong for pepr]
3) Plan to have conclusions from morning session: opinion piece, all collaborate (draft started) - repore - abstract pepr
thanks - thanks hosts
(clap)
