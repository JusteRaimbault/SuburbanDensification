#Résumé

Change detection using vector data is challenging when data specification and quality are not stable in time, as for example with buildings in BDTOPO with a time interval including 2015. Therefore, vector data matching algorithms can be used to remove such noise and accurately detect newly constructed entities. Such algorithms have however various case-dependant performances, and need to be parametrised. We describe a new algorithm with combines Geometric Matching of Areas and Multi-Criteria Matching algorithms, using the appropriate option on the type of potential links for which it performs best. We integrate the algorithm into the OpenMOLE platform, to optimise its performance for building change detection on ground-truth datasets of four case studies cities (Strasbourg, Toulouse, Dortmund, Frankfurt) between 2011 and 2021.
