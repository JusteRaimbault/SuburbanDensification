#Résumé

Suburban densification is a process important for urban sustainability, for example to limit urban sprawl and increase public transport ridership. Its dynamics remain difficult to grasp as many stakeholders at different scales are involved, from home and land owners to developpers and public authorities. They furthermore can change drastically with the context and country. We propose in this contribution a formal description of an agent-based simulation model, aimed at capturing such processes with enough genericity to be applied across 3 European countries (France, UK and Germany, studied in the context of the Subdense research project). The modular architecture allows including submodels for specific computations, such as the SimPLU3d model for densification potential and the ParcelManager model for land division. We expect this first proposal to be refined after its application to case studies and its calibration on empirical data, and a discussion with qualitative researchers working with densification stakeholders.
